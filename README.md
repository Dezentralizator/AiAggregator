################## LAUZHACK WINNING PRIZE ################

Disco is an open-source collaborative AI project.

At the Lauzhack, in a team of 2, we presented a federated algorithm who won the first prize of the contest organized by Disco. 

The federator of their collaborative AI was transformed into a smart contract allowing to have it fully run decentrally.

By using uint256s as Bitmaps, we managed to allow for significant size of neural networks to be updated.
